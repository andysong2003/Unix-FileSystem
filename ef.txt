In the forgotten village of Elmswood, the sun always set a little too early. The trees grew thick and close, and the fog never fully left the fields. People said the village had a secret, but no one ever spoke of it out loud—except for Nora.

Nora was thirteen, stubborn, and convinced that the strange lantern at the top of Hollow Hill held the key to Elmswood’s silence. Every evening, as the village darkened, the lantern would flicker to life—though no one ever climbed the hill to light it.

One autumn evening, with her coat buttoned to the chin and her flashlight tucked under her arm, Nora climbed the winding path to the top. The hill was steeper than she’d thought, and the wind whispered things that weren’t quite words.

At the summit, the lantern burned with a pale blue flame. It wasn’t hanging from a pole or perched on a wall—it floated.

As Nora stepped closer, the flame flickered and dimmed. Her flashlight blinked out. Everything stilled.

Then she heard it—a voice, faint and hollow: “Are you the new Keeper?”

Nora swallowed. “I don’t know. What does the Keeper do?”

The flame pulsed. “They remember. They guard the boundary. They keep the dark out.”

“And what happens if no one keeps it?” she asked.

The flame dimmed to a spark. “Then Elmswood forgets. And disappears.”

Nora stared at the light, then reached out. The moment her fingers brushed it, warmth bloomed through her chest, and the fog lifted—just slightly—from the valley below.

The village clock chimed. Midnight.

From that night on, the lantern burned steady. And though no one knew why, the mornings in Elmswood began to arrive a little earlier.

And Nora remembered.
